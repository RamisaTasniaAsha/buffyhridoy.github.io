## Abstract

Breast cancer is a comprehensively dreadful 
disease that primarily affects women worldwide. In a lifetime, 
one out of every eight women is diagnosed with breast cancer. 
The probability of patient survival rate increases if it is 
properly diagnosed at the benign stage. However, when a 
cancer cell metastasizes out from its original development site, 
it enters into a secondary stage with increasing aggression, 
infecting other organs via the bloodstream and lymph system. 
At this stage, the cancer cells become life-threatening, and the 
survival rate of patients falls drastically. So it is evident that 
early diagnosis is essential to minimize the extent of the 
metastasis. Traditional diagnostics procedures by a
pathologist are time-consuming and subject to human error. 
In this study, a custom-designed CNN network is proposed to 
distinguish metastasis cells from non-metastasis cells from 
histopathological breast cancer images. This proposed model 
has obtained an impressive training accuracy of 94.98% and 
a validation accuracy of 94.08%. The achieved average area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1-
score, recall, and precision of the CNN model are respectively 0.985, 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94. 
The experimental studies demonstrate the proposed modelâ€™s ability to distinguish 
metastasis cells with high accuracy.
