##Abstract 
As a cardinal sign of the pathological condition of human health, 
WBC also known as leukocytes have prominently regulated a functional role in 
the bodyâ€™s immune system. So, the classification of white blood cells has been 
kept on great precedence in the diagnosis of hematological diseases such as 
leukemia or any kind of blood cancers even AIDS so. But the evaluation 
process is quite complicated and painstaking as leukocytes include a series of 
variety within it. Following the drawbacks, deep learning can offer much 
refinement in the classification manner of leukocytes. Especially, the 
convolutional neural network i.e. CNN, an advanced and sophisticated 
technology that has been conceded widespread as a compatible approach 
regarding the visual image analysis. Thus considering the pledges, a new 
approach has been introduced in this paper based on a precisely established 
CNN model with an adjuration of outrun the traditional approaches proposed 
before that includes multiple complicated steps such as preprocessing, 
segmentation, feature extraction and so on in classifying four types of white 
blood cells. The model is established on a feasible study and a series of 
experiments conducted on large-scale training sets of 9,957 annotated blood 
smear images of WBCs (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) 
to perceive a hierarchical manner of learning and understanding automatically. 
And then the detection model is evaluated on test sets of 2,487 annotated blood 
smear images of WBCs. This diligent research results in salient recognition 
performance in classifying four types of WBCs with an accuracy of 98% on 
average. So, our proposed customized model can be used in the real-life 
healthcare sector for identifying diseases that also reduce the disease 
detection cost.
