## Abstract

Pneumonia is a bacterial infection-caused life-threatening respiratory disease. About 15% all over the world 
kid's loss of life is triggered via pneumonia. A new virus called 
COVID-19 (in which) most important indications are 
pneumonia. Computer-aided diagnostic (CADx) methods have 
been studied for decades for the diagnosis of chest X-ray 
images based on lung diseases. For visual recognition, these 
tools assess the image properties derived from CNN. CNN 
filters a photo to acquire information from the chest X-ray. 
Throughout this study, we consider the performance of a 
customized CNN model used as feature extractors by the way 
of a variety of classifiers to distinguish the unusual and 
pneumonic chest X-Rays. Statistical findings point out that our 
CADx model can assist in the evaluation of clinical images as 
well. The user can insert their chest radiograph to the web app 
and find out their pneumonia condition, whether it is present 
or not present. Our proposed identification method's accuracy 
is 94% which is very high compared with other states of 
artwork.
