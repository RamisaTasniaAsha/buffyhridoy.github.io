## Abstract

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is prevalent among a
large number of population who has diabetes. It is a very
critical disease which causes injury in the tissues of retina of
diabetic patients. Even, at its extreme point, it might cause
permanent blindness to the patients who suffer from DR for
a long period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose
these patients very soon to mitigate the severe impact of DR.
Several methods are proposed earlier to identify this disease using
machine learning algorithms, image processing, and so on. In this
work, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based pre-trained
machine learning algorithm is used to speed up the diagnosis of
the severity of DR using fundus photography of retinal images
of patients. The images are of five different classes which defines
the severity of the disease. We used EfficientNet-B5 along with an
optimizing threshold to further improve the result. We achieved
an accuracy of 0.9402 on the training set and 0.9333 on the testing
set which is represented by Quadratic Weighted Kappa score.
This proves the efficacy of our approach in DR classification.
Thus, our work can help the DR patients to reduce the probability
of having lifelong blindness.
