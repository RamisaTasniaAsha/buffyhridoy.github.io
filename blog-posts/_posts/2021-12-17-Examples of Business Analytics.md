title: Examples of Business Analytics
excerpt: Four examples of business analytics discussed in this post.

---


There are four key types of business analytics: `descriptive, predictive, diagnostic, and prescriptive`. 

- _`Descriptive analytics` is the interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns_.
- _`Predictive analytics` centers on taking that information and using it to forecast future outcomes_. 
- _`Diagnostic analytics` can be used to identify the root cause of a problem_. 
- _In `Prescriptive analytics`, testing and other techniques are employed to determine which outcome will yield the best result in a given scenario_.


Here is the example of how four companies are aligning with that trend and applying data insights to their decision-making processes.

## 1. Improving Productivity and Collaboration at Microsoft

In 2015 Microsoft sought to understand `how fostering face-to-face interactions among staff could boost employee performance and save money`.

Microsoft’s Workplace Analytics team hypothesized that moving the 1,200-person group from five buildings to four could improve collaboration by cutting down on the number of employees per building and reducing the distance that staff needed to travel for meetings. This assumption was partially based on an earlier study by Microsoft, which found that people are more likely to collaborate when they’re more closely located to one another.

In an article for the Harvard Business Review, the company’s analytics team shared the outcomes they observed as a result of the relocation. Through looking at metadata attached to employee calendars, the team found that the move resulted in a 46 percent decrease in meeting travel time. This translated into a combined 100 hours saved per week across all relocated staff members and an estimated savings of $520,000 per year in employee time.

The results also showed that teams were meeting more often due to being in closer proximity, with the average number of weekly meetings per person increasing from 14 to 18. In addition, the average duration of meetings slightly declined, from 0.85 hours to 0.77 hours. These findings signaled that the relocation
- _improved collaboration among employees_
- _increased operational efficiency_

For Microsoft, the insights gleaned from this analysis underscored the importance of in-person interactions and helped the company understand how thoughtful planning of employee workspaces could lead to significant time and cost savings.

## 2. Enhancing Customer Support at Uber
Ensuring a quality user experience is a top priority for ride-hailing company Uber. To streamline its customer service capabilities, in early 2018 the company developed a `Customer Obsession Ticket Assistant (COTA)`. 
>COTA—a tool that uses machine learning and natural language processing to help agents improve their speed and accuracy when responding to support tickets.

COTA’s implementation delivered positive results. The tool reduced ticket resolution time by 10 percent, and its success prompted the Uber Engineering team to explore how it could be improved.

For the second iteration of the product, COTA v2, the team focused on integrating a deep learning architecture that could scale as the company grew. Before rolling out the update, Uber turned to A/B testing
>A/B testing—a method of comparing the outcomes of two different choices (in this case, COTA v1 and COTA v2)—to validate the upgraded tool’s performance.

Preceding the A/B test was an A/A test, during which both a control group and a treatment group used the first version of COTA for one week. The treatment group was then given access to COTA v2 to kick off the A/B testing phase, which lasted for one month.

At the conclusion of testing, it was found that there was a nearly 7 percent relative reduction in average handle time per ticket for the treatment group during the A/B phase, indicating that the use of COTA v2 led to faster service and more accurate resolution recommendations. The results also showed that customer satisfaction scores slightly improved as a result of using COTA v2.

With the use of A/B testing, Uber determined that 
- _implementing COTA v2 would not only improve customer service_
- _but save millions of dollars by streamlining its ticket resolution process_

## 3. Forecasting Orders and Recipes at Blue Apron
For meal kit delivery service Blue Apron, understanding customer behavior and preferences is vitally important to its success. Each week, the company presents subscribers with a fixed menu of meals available for purchase and employs predictive analytics to forecast demand, with the aim of using data to 
- _avoid product spoilage_
- _fulfill orders_

To arrive at these predictions, Blue Apron uses algorithms that take several variables into account, which typically fall into three categories: `customer-related features, recipe-related features, and seasonality features`. 
- _`Customer-related features` describe historical data that depicts a given user’s order frequency_
- _`Recipe-related features` focus on a subscriber’s past recipe preferences, allowing the company to infer which upcoming meals they’re likely to order_. 
- _In `seasonality features`, purchasing patterns are examined to determine when order rates may be higher or lower, depending on the time of year_.

Through regression analysis, Blue Apron’s engineering team has successfully measured the precision of its forecasting models. The team reports that, overall, the root-mean-square error of their projection of future orders is consistently less than six percent, indicating a high level of forecasting accuracy.
>Regression analysis—a statistical method used to examine the relationship between variables

>The root-mean-square error—the difference between predicted and observed values 

By employing predictive analytics to better understand customers, Blue Apron has 
- _improved its user experience_
- _identified how subscriber tastes change over time_
- _recognized how shifting preferences are impacted by recipe offerings_.

## 4.Targeting Consumers at PepsiCo
Consumers are crucial to the success of multinational food and beverage company PepsiCo. To ensure the right quantities and types of products are available to consumers in certain locations, PepsiCo uses `big data and predictive analytics`.

PepsiCo created Pep Worx. With Pep Worx, the company `identifies shoppers in the United States who are likely to be highly interested in a specific PepsiCo brand or product`.
>Pep Worx-a cloud-based data and analytics platform called to make more informed decisions regarding product merchandising

For example, 
- _Pep Worx enabled PepsiCo to distinguish 24 million households from its dataset of 110 million US households that would be most likely to be interested in Quaker Overnight Oats_. 
- _Then the company identified specific retailers that these households might shop at and targeted their unique audiences_. 
- _Ultimately, these customers drove 80 percent of the product’s sales growth in its first 12 months after launch_
