  <summary>What is action potential and How to record an action potential?</summary>

  1. The action potential is the basic component of all bioelectrical signals 
  2. provides information on the nature of physiological activity at the single-cell level
  3. accompanies the mechanical contraction of a single cell when stimulated by an electrical current
  4. is caused by the flow of Na+, K+, Cl-, and other ions across the cell membrane

  Recording an action potential requires
  - isolation of a single cell
  - microelectrodes with tips of the order of a few micrometers

    To stimulate the cell and record the response

  <summary>Resting Potential</summary>

      In their resting state, 

      - membranes of excitable cells readily permit the entry of K+ and Cl- ions,
      - but effectively block the entry of Na+ ions

      **A cell in its resting state is said to be polarized**. 

      Most cells maintain a resting potential  -60 to - 100 mV until some disturbance or stimulus upsets the equilibrium

- What are results of the inability of Na+ to penetrate a cell membrane?
    1. Na+ concentration inside the cell
    2. The outside of the cell is more positive
    3. To balance the charge, additional K+ ions enter the cell
    4. Charge balance cannot be reached due to differences in membrane permeability for the various ions
    5. A state of equilibrium is established with a potential difference
    
    **A cell in its resting state is said to be polarized**. Most cells maintain a resting potential  -60 to - 100 mV until some disturbance or stimulus upsets the equilibrium
    
- Depolarization
    1. When a cell is excited by ionic currents or an external stimulus,
        - the membrane changes its characteristics
        - begins to allow Na+ ions to enter the cell
    2. This movement of Na+ ions constitutes an ionic current, 
    3. Ionic current reduces the membrane barrier to Na+ ions
    4. This leads to an avalanche effect
        - Na+ ions rush into the cell
        - K+ ions try to leave the cell, but cannot move as fast as the Na+ ions
