Data isn't actually alive, but it does have a life cycle. **_How do data analysts bring data to life?_** Well, it starts with the right **_data analysis tool._** These include 
- spreadsheets
- databases
- query languages
- visualization software

 The life cycle of data is 
 - **_plan_**: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
 
 - **_capture_**: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
 
 - **_manage_**: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
 - **_analyze_**: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
 - **_archive_**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
 - **_destroy_**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

**_The data life cycle provides a generic or common framework for how data is managed._** This blog provides a glimpse of how government, finance, and education institutions can view data life cycles a little differently.

## U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [Data Management Life cycle] 
The data life cycle organizes and illustrates the elements of data management. Their data are corporate assets with value beyond their immediate need and should be managed throughout the entire data life cycle. 

>Data quality management is the prevention of data defects that reduce our ability to apply data towards our science-based conservation efforts.

### 1. Plan
Planning for a project involves making decisions about 
- data management
- potential products
- data stewardship roles and responsibilities

**_It is important to document all stages of the data management life cycle and quality control prior to beginning a  new project._**

### 2. Acquire
Data can be acquired by 
- collecting new data
- processing old or legacy data
- collaborating with partners
- contracting others to collect data.

### 3. Maintain
Data maintenance includes 
- processing data for analysis
- creating metadata
- making sure data are in a format that can be accessed by others in the future


### 4. Access
The ability to 
- prepare
- release
- share quality data to the public, other agencies, and internally is an important part of the life cycle process.

### 5. Evaluate
Evaluate represents steps associated with 
- processing data
- analyzing data. 

Important goals for both the processing and analysis of data are **_maximizing accuracy and productivity while minimizing costs._**

### 6. Archive
Data archiving supports the **_long-term storage of scientific data and the methods used to read or interpret them._**

### Cross-Cutting Elements 
Cross-cutting elements describe activities that must be performed continuously across all stages of the lifecycle to help support effective data management.

### 1. Describe (Metadata, Documentation)
Throughout the data lifecycle, documentation must be created and updated to reflect actions taken upon the data. 
- Metadata Creation
- The Importance of Data Dictionaries
- Using Keywords for Data Discovery
 
### 2. Manage Quality
Data-quality management is a process where protocols and methods are employed to ensure that data are properly collected, handled, processed, used, and maintained at all stages of the scientific data lifecycle.
- Quality Assurance Plans
- Quality Assurance
- Quality Control
- Documenting Data Quality
 
### 3. Backup & Secure
Backing up and securing data involves protecting data from accidental data loss, corruption, and unauthorize access. 

## Harvard Business School (HBS)
Whether we manage data initiatives, work with data professionals, or are employed by an organization that regularly conducts data projects, a firm understanding of what the average data project looks like can prove highly beneficial to our career.
No two data projects are identical; each brings its own challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions that impact its trajectory. Nearly all data projects, however, follow the same basic life cycle from start to finish. This life cycle can be split into eight common stages, steps, or phases:

- **_Generation_**
- **_Collection_**
- **_Processing_**
- **_Storage_**
- **_Management_**
- **_Analysis_**
- **_Visualization_**
- **_Interpretation_**

### **_The data life cycle is often described as a cycle because the lessons learned and insights gleaned from one data project typically inform the next. In this way, the final step of the process feeds back into the first._**

### 1. Generation
For the data life cycle to begin, data must first be generated. Otherwise, the following steps can’t be initiated.

Data generation occurs regardless of whether we’re aware of it, especially in our increasingly online world. 
- Some of this data is generated by our organization, some by our customers, and some by third parties we may or may not be aware of. 
- Every sale, purchase, hire, communication, interaction—everything generates data. 

### **_Given the proper attention, this data can often lead to powerful insights that allow us to better serve our customers and become more effective in our role._**


### 2. Collection
Not all of the data that’s generated every day is collected or used. It’s up to our data team to identify what information should be captured and the best means for doing so, and what data is unnecessary or irrelevant to the project at hand.
We can collect data in a variety of ways, including:

- **Forms:** 
    - Web forms
    - client or customer intake forms
    - vendor forms
    - human resources applications 
    
        are some of the most common ways businesses generate data.

- **Surveys:** Surveys can be an effective way to **_gather vast amounts of information from a large number of respondents._**

- **Interviews:** Interviews and focus groups conducted with **_customers, users, or job applicants_** offer opportunities to **_gather qualitative and subjective data that may be difficult to capture through other means._**

- **Direct Observation:** Observing how a customer interacts with **_our website, application, or product_** can be an effective way to gather data that may not be offered through the methods above.

It’s important to note that many organizations take a broad approach to data collection, 
- capturing as much data as possible from each interaction
- storing it for potential use. 

While drawing from this supply is certainly an option, it’s always important to start by creating a plan to capture the data. 

### 3. Processing
Once data has been collected, it must be processed. Data processing can refer to various activities, including:

- **Data wrangling**, in which a data set is **_cleaned and transformed from its raw form into something more accessible and usable_**. This is also known as 
    - **data cleaning**
    - **data munging**
    - **data remediation**
- **Data compression**, in which data is **_transformed into a format that can be more efficiently stored._**
- **Data encryption**, in which data is **_translated into another form of code to protect it from privacy concerns._**

- Even the simple act of taking a printed form and digitizing it can be considered a form of data processing.

### 4. Storage
After data has been collected and processed, it must be stored for future use. 
- This is most **_commonly achieved through the creation of databases or datasets._** 
- These datasets may then be **_stored in the cloud, on servers, or using another form of physical storage like a hard drive, CD, cassette, or floppy disk._**

When determining how to best store data for our organization, it’s important to build in a certain level of redundancy to ensure that **_a copy of your data will be protected and accessible, even if the original source becomes corrupted or compromised._**



### 5. Management
Data management, **_also called database management_**, involves 
- organizing
- storing
- retrieving  

    data as necessary over the life of a data project. 
    
**_While referred to here as a “step,” Data management is an ongoing process that takes place from the beginning through the end of a project._** 

**_Data management includes everything from storage and encryption to implementing access logs and changelogs that track who has accessed data and what changes they may have made._**

### 6. Analysis
Data analysis refers to processes that attempt to **_glean meaningful insights from raw data._** Analysts and data scientists use different tools and strategies to conduct these analyses. Some of the more commonly used methods include 
- statistical modeling
- algorithms
- artificial intelligence
- data mining
- machine learning.

Exactly who performs an analysis depends on the specific challenge being addressed, as well as the size of organization’s data team. Business analysts, data analysts, and data scientists can all play a role.

### 7. Visualization
Data visualization refers to the process of creating graphical representations of  information, typically through the use of one or more visualization tools. Visualizing data makes it easier to quickly communicate our analysis to a wider audience both inside and outside our organization. The form our visualization takes depends on the data we’re working with, as well as the story you want to communicate.

While technically not a required step for all data projects, data visualization has become an increasingly important part of the data life cycle.



### 8. Interpretation
Finally, the interpretation phase of the data life cycle provides **_the opportunity to make sense of our analysis and visualization._** Beyond simply presenting the data, this is when we investigate it through the lens of our expertise and understanding. Our interpretation may not only include a description or explanation of what the data shows but, more importantly, what the implications may be.


### THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE DATA LIFE CYCLE
Even if we don’t directly work with our organization’s data team or projects, understanding the data life cycle can 
- empower us to communicate more effectively with those who do. 

- can provide insights that allow us to conceive of potential projects or initiatives.

## Financial institutions
Financial institutions may take a slightly different approach to the data life cycle as described in The Data Life Cycle, an article in Strategic Finance magazine:

### 1. Capture 
Business is surrounded by data, but an enterprise needs to capture it in order to make use of it. Data capture occurs in three major distinct ways:
 

- **Data Entry:** Manual or automated entry of data into the data warehouse to create new data values.

- **Data Acquisition:** Acquiring or transferring data from an already existing data source or data warehouse.

- **Connected Devices:** Internet of Things (IoT) has and will continue to transform the way data is captured by making it real time and continuous as devices listen to and interact with the environment and each other. These devices capture and transmit the data so it can be stored.

**_It's the most time-consuming step in the data life cycle._**  

### 2. Qualify 
- Inaccurate or incomplete data may lead to major problems later in the data life cycle. These problems may include 
- critical business processes being held up
- bad decision making
- final reports running afoul of compliance because of erroneous data values 

In this phase, data is assessed for its quality and completeness using a set of predefined rules.
 

The Capture and Qualify phases are traditionally seen as under the purview of the IT team, which sets up the system architecture. But management accountants, with their knowledge of accounting processes and the way data will be utilized in later phases, have the ability and responsibility to envision the framework of the system in partnership with IT.

 

### 3. Transform
- The advent of Big Data has led to enterprises being able to capture a seemingly infinite amount of data. 
- Couple this situation with IoT, and soon we can be drowning in data. 
- Thus, enterprises have to transform, synthesize, and simplify the data so it can be utilized by functional departments. 

This phase is commonly called **_“analytical modeling”_** in the financial world. A certain level of functional expertise is required at this phase as data from different sources is linked together to find the intrinsic value hidden beneath.
 

### 4. Utilize
- The final aim of data is to help enterprises make good business decisions, and, in some cases, data itself is the final product or service of the enterprise. Either way, **_the true value of data is unlocked in this phase_**, and the previous efforts made in data capture, qualification, and transformation finally bear fruit.
 
Management accountants act as business partners during the Transform and Utilize phases. As business partners, we need to translate the data values into business stories that help enterprise leadership understand the magnitude of their decisions and their long-term impact.

 

### 5. Report

- Reporting of data is a key phase of the data life cycle that is ripe for automation. Since rules, definitions, and requirements for these reports either rarely change or have slight changes year after year, automated processes designed by management accountants help to create and publish these reports in a more efficient manner.

- This phase relates to external reporting. Internal management reporting for decision making is realized during the Utilize phase in the data life cycle. External reporting could involve quarterly/yearly financial reports, financial data sent to other vendors for bids, and other compliance reports.
 

 

### 6. Archive
- Data archiving is the transfer of data from an active stage to a passive stage so that it can be retrieved and reutilized as needed.

- This is the beginning of the end for the data that the enterprise has spent a considerable amount of time and resources on to unlock its value. 
 

### 7. Purge
- It occurs in the data archive and is sometimes accompanied by a communication both inside and outside the enterprise.
 
- The final phase of the data life cycle is the removal of the data (and any copies) from the enterprise. 

Financial compliance rules within an enterprise or those imposed by regulatory bodies normally drive the Archive and Purge phases. And management accountants act as custodians to ensure that these compliance rules are followed within the enterprise for financial data.
