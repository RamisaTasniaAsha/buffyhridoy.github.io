## WEEK 1

Companies in e-commerce, entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, marketing, finance, tech, and hundreds of other industries use data. Organizations of all kinds need data analysts to help them  
> 1. `improve their processes`
> 2. `identify opportunities and trends`
> 3. `launch new products`
> 4. `provide great customer service`
> 5. `make thoughtful decision`

`That's how data turned into insights`

After analysts have created insights from data. Those insights are shared with others, decisions are made, and businesses take action. Data analytics can help organizations completely rethink something they do or point them in a totally new direction. For example, maybe data 
- *leads them to a new product or unique service*
- *helps them find a new way to deliver an incredible customer experience.*

It's these kinds of aha moments that can help businesses reach another level, and that makes data analysts vital to any business

>Data analysis is the `collection, transformation, and organization of data` in order to `draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making`. A data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

>The publication "The Economist" recently called data the world's most valuable resource

Different processes for data analysis are or phases of the data analysis process: `ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act`
>Data! Data! Data! I can't make bricks without clay.

This line was said by Sherlock Holmes

Data analytics can help organizations completely rethink something they do or point them in a totally new direction. For example, maybe data 
- *leads them to a new product or unique service*
- *helps them find a new way to deliver an incredible customer experience.*

It's these kinds of aha moments that can help businesses reach another level, and that makes data analysts vital to any business


Data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: 
- _machine learning_
- _statistics_ 
- _analytics_ 

>`Decision Intelligence` is a combination of applied data science and the social and managerial sciences. turn customers data into impact and make their businesses and the world better

>`Data ecosystems` are made up of various elements that _**interact with one another**_ in order to _**produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data**_. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them

Data can also be found in something called the cloud. 
>The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive. So the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location. So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet. 

The cloud plays a big part in the data ecosystem

As a data analyst, it's your job to 
- _harness the power of that data ecosystem_ 
- _find the right information_
- _provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions_

Here's some examples

### 1. Retail store's database

which is an ecosystem filled with 
- _customer names_
- _addresses_
- _previous purchases_
- _customer reviews_ 

As a data analyst, you could use this information to 
- _predict what these customers will buy in the future_
- _make sure the store has the products and stock when they're needed_ 

### 2. A data ecosystem used by a human resources department. 
This ecosystem would include information like 
- _postings from job websites_
- _stats on the current labor market_
- _employment rates_
- _social media data on prospective employees_ 

A data analyst could use this information to
- _help their team recruit new workers_
- _improve employee engagement and retention rates_ 

### 3. Agricultural companies regularly use data ecosystems 
that include information about 
- _geological patterns in weather movements_

Data analysts can use this data to 
- _help farmers predict crop yields_ 

### 4. Saving real environmental ecosystems
- _Some data analysts are using data ecosystems to save real environmental ecosystems_ 

### 5. Scripps Institution of Oceanography
- _coral reefs all over the world are monitored digitally_

So Data analysts can 
- _see how organisms change over time_
- _track their growth_
- _measure any increases or declines in individual colonies_

> Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data

>Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data(data science). Data analytics consist of 
>- _data_
>- data analysis
>- data ecosystem

>`Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources`


**_One of the most powerful ways we can put data to work is with data-driven decision-making._**
>Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy. 

Organizations in many different industries are empowered to make better, data-driven decisions by data analysts all the time. _**The first step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need. Usually, this is a problem that needs to be solved.**_ 
For example, 
- A problem could be a new company needing to establish better brand recognition, so it can compete with bigger, more well-known competitors. 
- An organization wants to improve a product and needs to figure out how to source parts from a more sustainable or ethically responsible supplier. 
- It could be a business trying to solve the problem of unhappy employees, low levels of engagement, satisfaction and retention. 

>**Whatever the problem is, once it's defined, a data analyst** 
>- _finds data_ 
>- _analyzes it_ 
>- _uses it to uncover_ 
>   - _**trends**_
>   - _**patterns**_ 
>   - _**relationships**_

Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what's worked in the past. Other times, it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction. Let's look at a real-world example. 
- Think about a music or movie streaming service. 
  - How do these companies know what people want to watch or listen to,
  - how do they provide it? 
  
  Using data-driven decision-making, they 
   - gather information about what their customers are currently listening to    
   - analyze it
   - then use the insights they've gained to make suggestions for things people will most likely enjoy in the future. 
   - this keeps customers happy and coming back for more
   - which in turn means more revenue for the company.  
- Data-driven decision-making can be seen in the rise of e-commerce. It wasn't long ago that most purchases were made in a physical store, but the data showed people's preferences were changing. So a lot of companies created entirely new business models that remove the physical store, and let people shop right from their computers or mobile phones with products delivered right to their doorstep. 

In fact, data-driven decision-making can be so powerful, it can make entire business methods obsolete. For example, 
- Data helped companies completely move away from corded phones and replace them with mobile phones. 

By ensuring that data is built into every business strategy, data analysts play a critical role in their companies' success, but it's important to note that no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as **_data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition._**  

>_**To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem.**_ These people are called `subject matter experts`. 

>`Subject matter experts` - they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made. 

>Organizations that work this way put data at the heart of every business strategy, but also benefit from the insights of their people. It's a win-win. 

>As a data analyst, us play a key role in empowering these organizations to make data-driven decisions, which is why it's so important for us to understand how data plays a part in the decision-making process.

## WEEK 2
### The **five** essential skills of a data analyst. 
- **_Curiosity:_** a desire to know more about something, asking the right questions 
- **_Understanding context:_** understanding where information fits into the “big picture”   
- **_Having a technical mindset:_** breaking big things into smaller steps 
- **_Data design:_** thinking about how to organize data and information
- **_Data strategy:_** thinking about the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis

**_`Curiosity` is all about wanting to learn something._** Curious people usually seek out new challenges and experiences. This leads to knowledge.  

**_Context_** is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment. A simple way of `understanding context` is by counting to 5. All of those numbers exist in the context of one through five. But what if a friend of ours said to us, one, two, four, five, three? Well, the **_three_** will be **_out of context._** But it can be a little tricky. There's a good chance that we might not even notice the **_three_** being **_out of context._** if we aren't paying close attention. That's why listening and trying to understand the full picture is critical.

**_`A technical mindset` involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way._** For instance, when paying our bills, 
- We probably already break down the process into smaller steps. 
- Maybe we start by sorting them by the date they're due. 
- Next, we might add them up and compare that amount to the balance in our bank account. 
- This would help you see if we can pay our bills now, or if we should wait until the next paycheck. Finally, we'd pay them. 

When we take something that seems like a single task, like paying our bills, and break it into smaller steps with an orderly process, that's `using a technical mindset.`

**_`Data design` is how we organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database._** For example, think about the way we organize the contacts in our phone. That's actually a type of data design. 
- Maybe we list them by first name instead of last
- Maybe we use email addresses instead of their names. 

What we're really doing is **_designing a clear, logical list_** that lets us call or text a contact in a quick and simple way

**_`Data strategy` is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis._** Let's break that down. 
- We **_manage people_** by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem we're working on. 
- For **_processes_**, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible. 
- For **_tools_**, we make sure the right technology is being used for the job. 

>`Analytical thinking` involves **_identifying and defining a problem_** and then **_solving it by using data_** in **_an organized, step-by-step manner._** 

As data analysts, how do we think analytically? The five key aspects to analytical thinking. They are 
- visualization
- strategy
- problem-orientation
- correlation
- big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

**_`Visualization` is the graphical representation of information._** Some examples include graphs, maps, or other design elements. Visualization is important because visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively

With so much data available, `having a strategic mindset` is key to staying focused and on track. `Strategizing` helps data analysts see **_what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there_**. Strategy also helps **_improve the quality and usefulness of the data_** we collect. Strategizing can help us accomplish our goals.

Data analysts use a `problem- oriented` approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project. For example, say a data analyst is told about the problem of a warehouse constantly running out of supplies. They would move forward with different strategies and processes. But the number one goal would always be solving the problem of keeping inventory on the shelves.

Data analysts also ask a lot of questions. This helps **_improve communication and saves time while working on a solution._** An example of that would be **_surveying customers about their experiences using a product and building insights from those questions to improve their product_**. This leads us to being able to identify a `correlation` between two or more pieces of data. A correlation is like a relationship. You can find all kinds of correlations in data. 
- Maybe it's the relationship between the length of our hair and the amount of shampoo we need. 
- Maybe we notice a correlation between a rainier season leading to a high number of umbrellas being sold. 

But as you start `identifying correlations` in data, there's one thing we always want to keep in mind: 
>`Correlation does not equal causation.` 

In other words, **_just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related._**

**_`Big-picture thinking` means being able to see the big picture as well as the details._** Big-picture thinking is like looking at a complete jigsaw puzzle. We can enjoy the whole picture without getting stuck on every tiny piece that went into making it. If we only focus on individual pieces, we wouldn't be able to see past that, which is why big-picture thinking is so important. **_It helps us zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities. This leads to exciting new ideas or innovations._** On the flip side, **_`detail-oriented thinking` is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help us execute a plan._** In other words, the pieces that make up your puzzle. There are all kinds of problems in the business world that can benefit from employees who have both `a big-picture and a detail-oriented way of thinking`. **_Most of us are naturally better at one or the other. But you can always develop the skills to fit both pieces together._**

For becoming a `versatile thinker` we need to be able to think
- **_analytically_**
- **_creatively_**
- **_critically_**

**_But why is it important to think in different ways?_** Because in data analysis, solutions are almost never right in front of us. We need to think 
- critically to find out the right questions to ask. But you also need to think - 
- creatively to get new and unexpected answers. 

Let's talk about some of the questions data analysts ask when they're on the hunt for a solution. 
### 1. What is the root cause of a problem?
>A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again. 
 
A simple way to wrap our head around root causes is with the process called the `Five Whys`. In the Five Whys you ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights. 

Here's an example of the Five Whys in action. Let's say we wanted to make a blueberry pie but couldn't find any blueberries. 
- We've been trying to solve a problem by asking, why can't I make a blueberry pie? The answer will be, there are no blueberries at the store. There's Why Number 1. 
- We then ask, why were there no blueberries at the store? Then you discover that the blueberry bushes don't have enough fruit this season. That's Why Number 2. 
- Next, you'd ask, why was there not enough fruit? This would lead to the fact that birds were eating all the berries. Why Number 3 
- Now we get to Why Number 4. Ask why a fourth time and the answer would be that, although the birds normally prefer mulberries and don't eat blueberries, the mulberry bush didn't produce fruit this season, so the birds are eating blueberries instead. 
- Finally, we get to Why Number 5, which should reveal the root cause. A late frost damaged the mulberry bushes, so it didn't produce any fruit. You can't make a blueberry pie because of the late frost months ago. 

See how the Five Whys can reveal some very surprising root causes. This is a great trick to know, and it can be a very helpful process in data analysis. 

### 2. Where are the gaps in our process?
For this, many people will use something called `gap analysis`. 
>Gap analysis lets us **_examine and evaluate how a process works currently_** in order to **_get where you want to be in the future_**. 

Businesses conduct `gap analysis` to do all kinds of things, such as 
- improve a product 
- become more efficient. 

>`The general approach to gap analysis is` 
>- `understanding where we are now compared to where we want to be.` 
>- `then we can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.`


### 3. What did we not consider before? 
This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so we can identify ways to **_make better decisions and strategies moving forward_**. 

These are just a few examples of the kinds of questions data analysts use at their jobs every day. As we begin our career, we'll think of a whole lot more. **_The way data analysts think and ask questions plays a big part in how businesses make decisions. That's why analytical thinking and understanding how to ask the right questions can have such a huge impact on the overall success of a business._**


We'll explore how analytical skills become part of data-driven decision-making. But first, let's look at the concept of data-driven decision-making and why it's more likely to lead to successful outcomes. Data-driven decision-making involved **_using facts to guide business strategy_**. Data analysts can tap into the power of data to do all kinds of amazing things. With data, they can
- gain valuable insights
- verify their theories or assumptions
- better understand opportunities and challenges
- support an objective
- help make a plan, and much more. 

In business, data-driven decision-making can improve the results in a lot of different ways. 

For example, 
1. Say a dairy farmer wants to start making and selling ice cream. They could guess what flavors customers would like, but there's a better way to get the information. 
    - The farmer could survey people and ask them what flavors they prefer. 
    - This gives the farmer the data they need to pick ice cream flavors people will enjoy. 

2. Let's say the president of an organization is curious about what perks employees value most. 
    - The president asked the human resources director who says people value casual dress code. It's a gut feeling, but the HR director backs it up with the fact that he sees a lot of people wearing jeans and t-shirts. 
    - But what if this company were to use a more structured employee feedback process, such as a survey? 
    - It might reveal that employees actually enjoy free public transportation cards the most. 
    - The human resources director just didn't realize that because he drives to work. 
  
There are just some of the benefits of data-driven decision-making. It 
- gives us greater confidence about our choice and our abilities to address business challenges.
- helps us become more proactive when an opportunity presents itself
- saves us time and effort when working towards a goal. 
  
Now let's learn more about how these five skills help us tap into all the potential of data-driven decision-making. 

- First, think about `curiosity and context`. **_The more we learn about the power of data, the more curious we're likely to become_**. We'll start to see patterns and relationships in everyday life, whether we're reading the news, watching a movie, or going to an appointment across town. The analysts take their thinking a step further **_by using context to make predictions, research answers, and eventually draw conclusions_** about what they've discovered. This natural process is a great **_first step_** in becoming more data-driven. 

- `Having a technical mindset` comes next. Everyone has **_instincts_**, or as in the case of our human resources director example, **_gut feelings_**. Data analysts are no different. They have gut feelings too. But **_they've trained themselves to build on those feelings and use a more technical approach to explore them_**. They do this by always 
  - seeking out the facts
  - putting them to work through analysis
  - using the insights they gain to make informed decisions. 

- Next, we come to `data design`, which has a strong connection to data-driven decision-making. To put it simply, **_designing our data so that is organized in a logical way makes it easy for data analysts_** to 
  - access
  - understand
  - make the most of available information 

- The final ability is `data strategy`, which incorporates 
  - the people
  - processes, and tools used to solve a problem

  This is a big one to remember because data strategy gives us a high-level view of the path we need to take to achieve our goals. 

**_Data-driven decision-making isn't a one-person job. It's much more likely to be successful if everyone is on board and on the same page,_** so it's important to make sure 
- specific procedures are in place and 
- technology being used is aligned with our data-driven strategy. 

Now we know how these five essential analytical skills work towards making better, data-driven decisions. So far, many of the examples we've heard are hypothetical. That means they could be true in theory, but aren't specific real-world cases. Next, we'll look at some real examples. 

1. The first story is about Google. At Google, their mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. All of their products, **_from idea to development to launch, are built on data and data-driven decision-making._** There are tons of examples at Google of people using facts to create business strategy. But one of the most famous ones has to do with Google's human resources. The HR department wanted to know **_if there was value in having managers. Were their contributions worthwhile? Or should everyone just be an individual contributor?_** 

    To answer that question, 
    - Google's people analytics team looked at 
    past performance reviews and employee surveys. 
    - The data they found was plotted on a graph because visuals are extremely helpful when trying to understand a problem or concept. 
    - The graph revealed that Googlers had positive feelings about their managers 
    - But the data was pretty general and the team wanted to learn more. So they dug deeper and split the data into `quartiles`. 
    >A quartile divides data points into four equal parts or quarters. Here's where the really cool stuff started happening. 
    - The data analysts discovered that there was a big difference between the very top and the very bottom quartiles. As it turned out, the teams with the best managers were significantly happier, more productive, and more likely to want to keep working at Google. 
    - This confirmed that managers were valued and make a big difference. 
    - Therefore, the idea of having only individual contributors was not implemented. 
    - But there was still more work to do. **_Just knowing that great managers create great results doesn't lead to actionable insights_**. They had to identify what exactly makes a great manager, so the team took two additional steps to collect more data. 
      - First, they launched an awards program where employees could nominate their favorite managers. For every submission they had to provide examples or data about what makes that manager great. 
      - The second step involved interviewing managers who were graphed on the top and bottom quartiles. 
          
    - This helped the analytics team see the differences between successful and less successful management behaviors. 
    - The best behaviors were identified as were the most common reasons for a manager needing improvement. 
    - The final step was sharing these insights and putting a procedure in place for evaluating managers with these qualities in mind. 
    
    This data-driven decision continues to create an exceptional company culture for my colleagues and me. 
    
2. Another interesting example comes from the nonprofit sector. 
    >Nonprofits are organizations dedicated to advancing a social cause or advocating for a particular effort, such as food security, education or the arts. 
  
   In this case, data analysts researched **_how journalists can make a more meaningful impact for the nonprofits they would write about._** Because journalists 
   - write for newspapers, magazines, and other news outlets
   - can help nonprofits reach readers like you and me, who then take action to help nonprofits reach their goals. 
   
   For instance, say we read about the problem of climate change in an online magazine. If the article is effective, we'll 
   - learn more about the cause and might even be compelled to make greener choices in your day-to-day life 
   - volunteer for a nonprofit
   - make a donation
   
   That's an example of the journalist's work bringing about awareness, understanding, and engagement. 
   
   The data analysts 
   - used a tracker to monitor story topics, clicks, web traffic, comments, shares and more. 
   - Then they evaluated the information to make recommendations for how the journalists could do their jobs even better. 
   - In the end, they came up with some great ideas for how nonprofits and journalists can motivate people everywhere to work together and make the world a better place.    

## WEEK 3:

The **data analysis process phases** are **_ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act_.** We're going to really dig in and explore **_how each of these phases work together._** First, let's spend a little time understanding the `data life cycle.` No, data isn't actually alive, but it does have a life cycle. **_How do data analysts bring data to life?_** Well, it starts with the right **_data analysis tool._** These include 
- spreadsheets
- databases
- query languages
- visualization software. 

 The life cycle of data is 
 - **_plan_**: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
 - **_capture_**: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
 - **_manage_**: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
 - **_analyze_**: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
 - **_archive_**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
 - **_destroy_**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.


### `Planning` phase 
 This actually happens well before starting an analysis project. 
 
 During `planning`, a business decides 
 - **_what kind of data it needs_**
 - **_how it will be managed throughout its life cycle_**
 - **_who will be responsible for it_** 
 - **_the optimal outcomes_** 
 
 For example, let's say an electricity provider wanted to **_gain insights into how to save people energy._** In the `planning phase`, they might decide to capture information on 
 - how much electricity its customers use each year
 - what types of buildings are being powered
 - what types of devices are being powered inside of them. 
 - which team members will be responsible for **_collecting, storing, and sharing that data._** 
 
 All of this happens during planning, and it **_helps set up the rest of the project._** 
 
### `Capturing` phase
 This phase happens when we capture data. This is where data is 
 - collected from a variety of different sources
 - brought into the organization 
 
 With so much data being created everyday, the ways to collect it are truly endless. 
 - One common method is getting data from outside resources. 
 
    For example, if we were doing data analysis on weather patterns, we'd probably get data from a publicly available dataset like the National Climatic Data Center. 
    
- Another way to get data is from a company's own documents and files, which are usually stored inside a database. 

  >A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. 
  
  In the case of our electricity provider, the business would probably measure data usage among its customers within a database that it owns. 
  
  As a quick note, when we **_maintain a database of customer information, ensuring data integrity, credibility, and privacy are all important concerns._**  
 

### `Managing` phase
Here we're talking about 
- how we care for our data
- how and where it's stored
- the tools used to keep it safe and secure
- the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly 

This phase is very important to `data cleansing` 

### `Analyzing` phase
This is where data analysts really shine. In this phase, the data is used to 
- solve problems
- make great decisions
- support business goals 

### `Archiving` phase
Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again. During analysis, analysts handle huge amounts of data. Can we imagine if we had to sort through all of the available data that's out there, even if it was no longer useful and relevant to our work? It makes way more sense to archive it than to keep it around. 

### `Destroying` phase
It sounds sad, but when we destroy data, it won't hurt a bit. So let's get back to our electricity provider example. They would have data stored on multiple hard drives. To destroy it, the company would use a secure data erasure software. If there were any paper files, they would be shredded too. This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.

**_We understand the different phases data goes through during its life cycle, we can better understand how to approach the data analysis process._**
